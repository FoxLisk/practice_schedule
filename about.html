                This is a tool to help you cycle through practice topics in a variety of subjects.
                In my case, I wanted to cycle through different families of topics in when practicing guitar;
                for example, I want to make sure to dedicate some practice time to reviewing chords, some to
                reviewing scales, etc. I want to be make sure I hit all the topics on rotation rather than trusting
                myself to never skip a boring topic because <span class="font-italic">"I just practiced that"</span>.

            On the <a href="/" class="text-emerald-600">home page</a>,
            upload a file with
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Syntax" class="underline text-emerald-600">JSON</a>
            defining your preferred categories and topics.
            Here is an example file, which you can
                <a href="/guitar.json"
                   download="guitar_categories.json"
